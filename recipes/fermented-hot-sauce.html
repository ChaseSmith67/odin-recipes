        <h3 class="description">A surprisingly simple, yet delicious, hot sauce that's actually good for you.</h3>

        <p>
            This complex hot sauce makes a great addition to many dishes.
            The heat of the peppers combines nicely with the sweetness of the fruit
            and the acid produced through natural fermentation. It takes some patience,
            but the finished product is packed with probiotics and is delicious.
            The flavors continue to develop over time.
